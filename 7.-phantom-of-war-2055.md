# 7. Phantom of War (2055)

The European battlefield witnessed the appearance of massive unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The global news media was reporting on the involvement of UFOs and aliens in the conflict, but the Western mainstream media subsequently released a statement denying the reports and blocked further coverage.

However, in the virtual world of the Heaven Island Metaverse, Japanese media outlets broadcasted a video to global users showing the activation of the DragonCapsule dark-matter engine and its attack on the Russian Iskander-M ballistic missile system in Kaliningrad.

It can be concluded that the DragonCapsule has been deployed as a secret weapon of attack on the battlefield.
