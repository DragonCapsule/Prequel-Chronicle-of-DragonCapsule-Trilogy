# Mount Fuji Project

The Japanese "Mount Fuji" DragonCapsule Relic Project has already activated four DC symbiotes. There are over 53 DC relic control blocks that have been detected but not yet controlled or activated.

One of the DragonCapsule symbiotes is a quantum matrix machine dragon, which has the ability to communicate through quantum matrix technology. The Japanese military has begun to utilize this new discovery to detect and contact unknown robot DC.
