# Phantom of the Persian Gulf

In June 2024, when the war in the Persian Gulf was looming, a "daily photo" released by the United States' National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has recently sparked global public discussion. The photo was taken by an astronomer in the Persian Gulf, but the image captured was described as "the red devil's horns." Experts have clarified that this was due to a solar eclipse.

NASA, FBI, and the China National Space Administration (CNSA) all received reliable information one day ago that the DC , Sea Wave Head, which had been activated by an unknown force, had been detected in the deep sea of the Indian Ocean and was moving towards the Persian Gulf.

The DC Sea Wave Head slowly emerged from the Persian Gulf, with huge waves sweeping across the sea surface, and a giant black cube-shaped object the size of a small mountain floated above the sea.

An imperceptible, powerful ultra-low frequency shockwave (infrasound) was emitted silently from the core of the DC Sea Wave Head, rapidly spreading across the vast Indian Ocean.

In the blink of an eye, the Sea Wave Head gradually became translucent, and disappeared from the ocean surface, with the horns transforming into the image of the red devil's horns in the Persian Gulf.
