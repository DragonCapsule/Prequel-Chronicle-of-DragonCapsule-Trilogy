# Flashback to Lop Nor - 1964

**"Sands stretch out to the horizon,**&#x20;

**the yellow sky above.**&#x20;

**Heroes' names are buried for fifty years.**&#x20;

**The wind howls over the Sword River, and the clouds are vast.**&#x20;

**The general's golden armor is never removed at night."**

&#x20;_-- A tribute to the swordsmiths who forged the Republic's sword._



In November 1964, in the remote region of Lop Nur in China, the endless yellow sand and scorching sun stretched to the horizon as if endlessly extended by the hot air currents.&#x20;

Slowly, amidst the visual distortion caused by convective heat waves near the ground, a plume of smoke rose from the distance. Gradually approaching, amidst the dimly undulating terrain, it became apparent that it was a military green jeep. Old Liu, with his hand shading his eyes, looked for a long time and then shouted in a low voice, "Finally, you turtle grandson have arrived..."

Old Liu, whose real name was Liu Bao, was a general who made outstanding contributions in measuring the physics of nuclear tests. In 1959, he came to Lop Nur after graduating from university, and even his wedding was held in a cellar on the Gobi desert.&#x20;

Not only did Old Liu plan to devote his whole life to the nuclear test site, but he also intended to send his son and grandson to the nuclear test base, fulfilling his vow with action: to dedicate his youth, lifetime, and descendants. He was a representative of the swordsmiths who forged the Republic.



In the blink of an eye, the Gazi jeep brought a gust of dust and sand before them as it screeched to a sudden halt with a creaking sound. The door opened slowly and steadily. A tall and agile military man jumped out, with a pale, bloodless complexion due to prolonged lack of sunlight, and wore a pair of rare oversized black sunglasses. If it weren't for his distinct Sichuanese baozi face, he would have looked a bit like the American actor Marlon Brando.

The man fixed his gaze on Old Liu. Though his expression remained unchanged, the corners of his mouth twitched slightly, curling upwards. Old Liu's guard, Xiao Sun, immediately sprang up like a spring, standing at attention and saluting. He shouted "Greetings, Commander!" but the man waved his hand to indicate he needn't do so.

Old Liu couldn't hold back any longer. He walked a few steps forward, and his previously darkened face broke into a wide smile, with a hoarse voice unique to those who had spent a long time in Lop Nur, he shouted, "You turtle grandson, Old Li, I've been waiting for you for seven or eight days!" He went up and hugged the man tightly.

Old Li's real name was Li Mei, and his armband read "General Staff Headquarters" and "Special Intelligence Department," but his real name could not be disclosed due to his "special status."Without any unnecessary movements, Old Li firmly grasped the black synthetic leather briefcase with his left hand and gave Old Liu's slightly thin shoulders a hard hug with his right hand. He said, "Miss Qiu's discovery has already received instructions from higher-ups. Let's go back to the base command post to discuss." He then turned around and pushed Old Liu onto the military jeep. The engine quickly started with a rumble, and the military truck and jeep drove deep into the desert one after the other.





_**A Central Military Commission investigator accidentally triggered the symbiotic mechanism, activating the DragonCapsule LopNur Head. China excavated the first DragonCapsule prototype, officially codenamed "Lei Zhenzi." This was the first time China at the national level became aware of the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations, and as a result, opened up research and development of extraterrestrial civilization relic resources.**_

**Note1: Project 596** (internal Chinese codename "Miss Qiu," CIA codename "Chic-1\[1]") was the first atomic bomb developed by the People's Republic of China. The bomb successfully detonated on October 16, 1964, in Lop Nur. Along with the first missile carrying a nuclear warhead in 1966, the first hydrogen bomb in 1967, and the first artificial satellite in 1970, they are collectively known as the "Two Bombs, One Satellite" project.

The name "596" was chosen to commemorate the Soviet Union's unilateral decision to halt its assistance in China's atomic bomb development in June 1959.

**Note2ï¼š**Your guess is correct: Li Mei is indeed White Eyebrows.
