# Fengshen Bang

A small group of core scientific research personnel who had early contact with the Dragon Capsule recommended to the Chinese government to establish a national project for research. The Chinese government granted special approval to establish the Extraterrestrial Civilization Relic Scientific Research Experiment Base (CECSEB) in Lop Nur, and the construction of the first-generation Dragon Capsule Ark experimental body began.

Starting in 1976, the CECSEB quietly recruited relevant personnel worldwide and systematically carried out exploration and scientific research on extraterrestrial civilization relic resources. This project was named the **"Fengshen Bang"** （The Investiture of the Gods）by the Central Military Commission of China.
