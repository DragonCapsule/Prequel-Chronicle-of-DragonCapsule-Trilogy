# Lei Zhenzi - Thunder

The discovery of "Lei Zhenzi" （NATO code name Thunder）caused a great stir among the Chinese government's top officials. The Chinese extraterrestrial relic research program was quietly launched in Lop Nur. As the first extraterrestrial civilization research subject, "Lei Zhenzi" was seen by the Chinese government as having enormous potential scientific and strategic value. Some scientists even proposed developing extraterrestrial relics and constructing future space bases and giant interstellar arks as part of a long-term development plan.
