# Volume 1. Incubation

\
In the 1.98 million years of the Cosmic Gamma Era , the Divine Dragon civilization was defeated in the multi-dimensional parallel universe war, and the Divine Dragon Realm Continent fell.&#x20;

A superluminal curvature spacecraft carrying the bloodline of the Divine Dragon family escaped the two-dimensional battlefield, and together with the 10,000 DragonCapsules on the spacecraft, it accidentally crashed into the solar system.&#x20;

The 10,000 DragonCapsules were scattered around the world with the crash of the spacecraft.
