* **Nature Dragon**: The ruling class of the home planet of the Shenlong continent is also the dragon family with the largest population, the most advanced technology, the highest IQ, the most subspecies, and the most friendly and inclusive dragon. It has the power to summon light and natural dragons. The Natural Dragon Capsule is generally very friendly and loyal to the human host. However, when the curvature spacecraft escaped from the two-dimensional space battlefield, part of the Natural Dragon Capsule was eroded and mutated in the two-dimensional space, and the result is unpredictable.

\


* **Robot Dragon:** The second largest race on the home planet of the God Dragon Continent. A long time ago, some nature dragons abandoned the biological evolution route and chose to combine it with cyber intelligence and machine civilization. Robot dragons possess powerful force, unparalleled quantum intelligence, and machine civilized control ability. In the long process of evolution, the robot dragon races developed a shared spatial quantum matrix brain, which allowed the robotic dragon to communicate and process information in parallel at infinite distances. The entire robotic dragon race gradually became a distributed quantum intelligent form.

\


* **Skull Dragon:** Originated from the ancient dark dragon family, it has the power to connect to the multi-dimensional string universe, has the power to summon the dark dragon, can erode the will to occupy the host at any time, and uses the host as a symbiotic incubator, with almost no emotions, no good and evil The skull dragon can connect to the multi-dimensional universe. It is the most destructive dragon race, but the skull dragon race cannot survive independently. Every 100 years, a psychic magic dragon must be found in the nature dragon races and made her become the light praying mage of the skull dragon race. to avoid the skull dragon race being permanently swallowed by the dark multidimensional universe.
