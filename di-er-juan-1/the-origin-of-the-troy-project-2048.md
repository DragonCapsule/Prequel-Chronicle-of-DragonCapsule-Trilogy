# The Origin of the Troy Project (2048)

In 1955, the United States established a temporary military base and secret weapons testing site in Nevada, which later became known as Area 51. They studied the Dragon Capsules of the Mayan civilization obtained from South America and launched the "Trojan Plan."

In 2048, A biological laboratory sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense in South America used the technological achievements of the DragonCapsules to develop a nanorobot structural reconstruction technology. However, the experiment did not achieve the planned success, and a small accident occurred: a sample of the nanorobots leaked into the natural environment outside the laboratory.
