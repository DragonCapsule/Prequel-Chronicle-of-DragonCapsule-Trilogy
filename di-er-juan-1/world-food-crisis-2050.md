# World Food Crisis (2050)

Between 2050 and 2054, there was a significant and sustained decline in global food production. Scientists gradually observed that global food crops, such as wheat, rice, and corn, showed a continuous decline in output and quality.

During their investigation, Russian scientists accidentally discovered a new type of microbe called "water cancer." It is a nanoscale microbe that exists widely in natural water bodies around the world. However, under certain conditions, this microbe exhibits a focusing effect and is the culprit behind the decline in global crop production.

Subsequently, research institutions from countries such as Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and Mexico claimed that they had detected the new nano-microbe "water cancer" in water samples collected from natural environments as early as 2049.

Despite investigations conducted by the United Nations and research into biological weapons, no definitive conclusions were reached.
