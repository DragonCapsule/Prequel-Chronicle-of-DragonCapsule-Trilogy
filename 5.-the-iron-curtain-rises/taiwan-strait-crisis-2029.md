# Taiwan Strait Crisis (2029)

Under the pressure of the crisis of Japanese archipelago sinking, the Japanese military launched an internal coup. The radical young officers of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces lost control and prepared for a full-scale surprise attack on Taiwan, intending to attack the Chinese relief volunteer army stationed in Taiwan.

The Japanese military attempted to land on Taiwan, set up temporary military transport facilities, and deploy defensive military forces. However, this move did not escape the watchful eye of China's intelligence agencies. The Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force was subjected to a surgical military strike by China before it could even approach Taiwan.

The U.S. military sent aircraft carriers to assist Japan and Taiwan, and a standoff between carrier battle groups from China and the U.S. began in the Taiwan Strait. The world was on the brink of a major war.

The two powers of China and the U.S. quickly launched peace talks and held a global three-party humanitarian assistance meeting on the Japan issue, reaching a temporary agreement on a humanitarian relief plan: the Japanese Self-Defense Forces would remove their armed functions and transform into a humanitarian security and local autonomous security force. The Chinese government agreed to establish a large-scale humanitarian relief settlement area on Monkey Island in Fujian Province, jointly resolving the humanistic crisis of Japan sinking, and planning the coastal areas of Fujian Province as a special area for emergency relief and life support for Japan.
