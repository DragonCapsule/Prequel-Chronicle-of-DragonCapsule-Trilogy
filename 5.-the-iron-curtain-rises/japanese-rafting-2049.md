# Japanese Rafting (2049)

The Japanese military secretly proposed the Mount Fuji Plan to the Japan Disaster Provisional Government, which aimed to explore and compete for the Dragon Capsule relics worldwide and rebuild Japan in Antarctica.

During the investigation of the Mount Fuji Plan, the internal investigator of the Japan Disaster Provisional Government, Sambonjirou, contacted the key figure of Fuji-Ichi, Ishihara Yuga. He discovered that the so-called geological secondary disaster was actually caused by the Japanese military's giant Dragon Capsule under Mount Fuji - "Fuji-Ichi".

Fuji-Ichi was a super geological weapon with power completely beyond the control of the Japanese military. It eventually caused the central fault zone of the Japanese archipelago to fracture, leading to secondary disasters and the sinking of the Japanese islands.

Sambonjirou chose to leak the information, causing the Japanese government to be extremely passive.

The Chinese and Russian governments pushed for the establishment of a crisis investigation team for the Japanese archipelago at the United Nations, demanding that the Japanese government cooperate and submit all relevant information about the sinking of Japan and make the investigation results public.

After weighing the pros and cons and negotiations, the Japan Disaster Temporary Government and the military planned to get rid of the multiple restrictions of the China Fujian settlement, and under pressure, ultimately agreed to China's proposal of distributed migration and requested the establishment of an independent settlement in Antarctica.

In 2049, the United Nations approved the proposal. Under the organization of the United Nations, Japan and the recipient countries began to build nine global refugee settlements, launching the "survival, security, employment, development" humanitarian disaster migration plan for the Japanese, known as the "Japan Rafting Plan".
