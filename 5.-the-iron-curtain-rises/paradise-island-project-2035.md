# Paradise Island Project (2035)

In 2031, Musk's brain-machine system made a major breakthrough, and for the first time, humans were able to connect their biological consciousness to the computer network through a brain-machine interface.

In 2935, a Russian genius launched the Heaven Island Project, the world's first autonomous metaverse system, and launched the metaverse immigration plan, inviting Japan to be the first to settle in.

This is a revolutionary plan that realizes key migration validation for living in the Metaverse in middle term,and only conducts necessary nutritional and medical services offline.

With the rapid improvement and development of the pillar service of the Heaven Island Biomedical Technology Company - the long-term life support system, humans can survive in the metaverse environment for up to three months without going offline.

Real-world programs, art, and creative work began to enter Heaven Island in bulk.

Heaven Island built the world's largest metaverse settlement in Antarctica, and plans to gradually build 10 million-level metaverse settlements globally.

Heaven Island attracted a large number of Japanese refugees to join, making the Japanese the first large-scale metaverse immigrants and the largest ethnic group in Heaven Island's metaverse.



The Japanese government is is not willing to see the virtualization of the Japanese nation's existence. In the eyes of the ruling elite, this way of life is extremely fragile and could lead to a qualitative change resulting in the disappearance of the Japanese people as a distinct ethnic group.

However, only a few elite members of the Japanese government have a vague awareness that as the first wave of large-scale metaverse immigrants, the new Japanese ethnic group entering the metaverse may give birth to unpredictable and powerful metaverse technologies and the first strong decentralized national civilization.
