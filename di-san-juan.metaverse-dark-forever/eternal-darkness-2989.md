# Eternal Darkness (2989)

### _**》》 Prequel: The Final Chapter**_



Whether immortal humans remain humans or have evolved into a new species is a subject of contemplation.

Throughout the ages, symbiotic beings have observed it all, pondering the meaning of existence: "Are we still Humans? Dragons? Or an entirely new species beyond comprehension?"

Humans themselves are also reflecting: "Have we opened a new world or unleashed an eternal darkness from Pandora's Box?"

This inevitably brings to mind a long-standing historical question:

> #### What led to the demise of the immortal Dragon race?&#x20;
>
> ####
>
> #### Let us journey back to the Gamma Epoch, 1.98 million years ago, and explore the depths of the Dragon Galaxy in the superstring cosmos....
>
>
>
> #### Perhaps the answer lies beyond the horizon**！！！**
