# Random Seed (millions of years ago)

For billions of years, the immortality of the divine Dragon race has been like an infinite curse, leading to the ultimate extinction of the Dragon race.

Millions of years ago, the Cosmic String Curvature Tinder spacecraft crashed into the solar system carrying the last hope of the Dragon Clan.

Before the spark ship was launched, the last high priest of the Shenlong tribe chose a seed - a carbon-based symbiont random factor, and put him into the gene of the dragoncapsule. Perhaps, this would be the antidote to the dragon's curse of immortality.
