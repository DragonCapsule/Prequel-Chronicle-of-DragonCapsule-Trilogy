# Ancient China Sinking

From 304 AD to 439 AD, after the Eight Kings Rebellion, the Western Jin Dynasty lost control of the world, and the nomadic people outside the Great Wall took advantage of the Eight Kings Rebellion in the late Western Jin Dynasty, and successively established non-Han regimes, forming a confrontation with the Han people in the south. The five Hu tribes, including the Huns, the Xianbei, the Jie, the Qiang, and the Di, are known as the “the chaos of the Five Barbarians” in history, and they have opened up the darkest and bloodiest side of ancient china history.

The Central Plains region fell into the hands of the Hu people, while in the south, patriotic generals of the Eastern Jin Dynasty such as Zuzu, Yuliang, Yinhao, Huanwen, and Liuyu raised their flags and launched multiple expeditions to reconquer the Central Plains. The chaos of the Five Barbarian Invasions brought about a series of wars and conflicts, which can be considered a disaster for the Han ethnic group, nearly leading to their extinction. This period is known in history as the 'Yongjia Rebellion, Ancient China sinking'
