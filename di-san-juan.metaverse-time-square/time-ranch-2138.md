# Time Ranch (2138)

In Switzerland in 2138, take a train to the beautiful Mount Pilatus, and you can see the beautiful scenery along the way. Sometimes you can see cows grazing leisurely beside the train, listening to the sound of cow bells.

The scenery on the mountain was breathtaking, too shocking to express in words and photos, but Satoshi didn't care to appreciate it. He waited anxiously, not knowing what everything in his thesis would look like in reality.

The gear train stopped, and Sara led Satoshi to change into a three-wheeled mountain off-road vehicle. The two drove along a path with a No Do Not Enter sign. About half an hour later, they came to a white castle , the castle is not big, it looks like it was recently renovated

Without saying anything extra, under the leadership of the castle staff, the two entered the castle, entered the elevator on the side, and fell to the ground. After about 3 minutes, the elevator reached the end. Satoshi stepped out of the elevator and looked out. He was overwhelmed by the spectacular scene in front of him Live: This is a huge hollowed out mountain, the whole is like a huge white nest standing upright, the space wall is composed of countless hexagonal capsule spaces of 2\~3 meters square, extending upwards to invisible heights.. .

Sara pulled the stunned Satoshi and said in a slightly sarcastic mezzo-soprano: "Welcome to Time Ranch"...

Staring at the white figure in the giant hive capsule in the distance, Satoshi murmured: Time ranch... what is grazing is the future of mankind.

Satoshi is well aware of the potential power of his thesis. Whoever masters time will have the power of the fourth dimension. This is an absolute advantage. Humans will have the ability of gods.

Sara paused for a while, and continued to introduce that the ranch can accommodate 4,000 people to collaborate online at the same time, and each grazing cycle is up to 45 days... You can see that the running project above is: "AI-Driven Parallel Metaverse Social Moral Evolution Path".
