# Time Travel - Laplace's Demon (2078)

_**"Does time truly exist, and what does time truly entail...?"**_

The contemplation of time will never cease; it is both one of the most difficult scientific questions to explain and an eternal philosophical issue.

About 50 years before Satoshi published "_**On the Time Compression Effect in the MetaVerse,**_" during the early prototype construction phase of the AtomVerse, Arthur already had a profound foundational concept for time.

Although the AtomVerse has a definite correlation with time in the real world, the AtomVerse is a self-contained, timeless universe. "_**TimeLess**_" has already clarified in its literal sense that within the AtomVerse system, _**there is no concept of time.**_

The AtomVerse's core code is anchored in the decentralized global blockchain network. Within this realm, all phenomena are sequences of events, with no concept of time as we know it. The blockchain, in essence, acts as a "_**time machine**_" for the AtomVerse, with each block signifying the elapsed unit of an **event sequence**. The timestamps on these sequences are the sole points of contact with the "time" of the real world,  serving merely as query parameters for data indexing in real world.&#x20;

In the early prototype design of the AtomVerse, the concept of "**time**" was actually defined and introduced as an "**event sequence.**" It is essentially the sequence in which events occur.



For the AtomVerse system, which is blockchain-founded, all information is immutable, including the sequence of events - "time" . Yet, on a philosophical plane, Arthur maintains that time travel is not only possible but also achievable.

The rationale is straightforward: if time travel can be conceived within the mind, then why should it be unattainable within the AtomVerse, the most potent virtual domain?

Based on this foundational concept, time travel becomes a rational and wonderful reality in the AtomVerse: "parallel universes".

Each time travel backward triggers a _**atomverse fork**_, and from the moment you go back to the past, a branched parallel universe is created.

In theory, there is no upper limit to the branching of the AtomVerse, and it can produce an infinite number of **"parallel universes**", limited only by resources.

All time and recursive paradoxes, such as "_**you went back and killed your grandfather**_" , are permissible in the AtomVerse. The only difference lies in the fact that the repercussions and influences of any actions are confined to the forked "parallel universe" through which you traversed time.

### Laplace's Demon

In contrast to retrograde time travel (**backward jump)**, the act of prograde time travel （**forward jump**）—venturing into the future—in the AtomVerse's nascent period was exceedingly resource-intensive. Traveling back in time was a journey to a "parallel universe" with known states; whereas, advancing into the future led to an entirely new "parallel universe" with an unknown state.

To facilitate this temporal travel, Arthur devised "Laplace's Demon." This machine, nigh-omnipotent in its capabilities, was crafted with the intent of possessing omniscience, using these knowledge to compute and predict all outcomes. To Laplace's Demon, the universe was akin to a vast, deterministic clock, with both the past and future etched in stone.  It feeds on calculations, tirelessly computing and verifying the events of the past and future.

Each **prograde leap by Laplace's Demon** induced vast tremors throughout the AtomVerse, for stepping into the future would alter the present, and any change in the present would ripple into the future, triggering immense iterative computations.  ensuring a seamless integration and smooth transition between the known realities and the uncharted territories of time.

To avert such AtomVerse tremors, Laplace's Demon refined its algorithms. Post prograde jump, the newly bifurcated parallel universe would  generate a finite past from the point of divergence, while simultaneously unfolding an infinite future, thus becoming a complete parallel universe in its own right.

On a parallel note, Arthur clandestinely engineered _**Heisenberg**_, a machine purpose-built to sow chaos. It could initiate from any minute event, rapidly amplifying its effects to staggering scales, and fundamentally disrupting the predictability of parallel universes' evolution. Heisenberg's raison d'être was to counterbalance Laplace's Demon, as _**the Demon could never become a true deity.**_

Laplace's Demon, at its core, is a machine of prognostication. Arthur endowed it with unique faculties: knowledge and computational prowess, the capacity to calculate the unknown from the known. This is an exceedingly terrifying force, and the price is that Laplace's Demon never have **free will,**  forever subject to Arthur's command.

There is one parallel universe branch that Arthur never allowed Laplace's Demon to explore: "Is it possible that the complete randomness injected by Heisenberg,  one day trigger Laplace's Demon's rebellion and refusal against Arthur?"&#x20;

Not that he didn't want to know the answer, but the moment this thought emerged, it was immediately, automatically, and permanently frozen by Arthur himself...

Perhaps infinite free will is an untouchable cyclical curse for all creators!

The AtomVerse forks into infinite "parallel universes,"  resembling a boundless, colossal _**Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG),**_ endlessly evolving and stretching through the fabric of multidimensional space-time.

_**Note:** Directed acyclic graph (DAG), In graph theory, if a directed graph starting from any vertex cannot return to that point through several edges, then the graph is a directed acyclic graph._
