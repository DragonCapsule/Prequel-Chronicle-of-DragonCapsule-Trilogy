# Metaverse Flourishes (2100)

Entering the year 2100, with the comprehensive maturation of Fully-Immersive Metaverse technologies represented by Paradise Island and AtomVerse, the MetaVerse is experiencing an era of unprecedented prosperity.

The Earth MetaVerse encompasses a myriad of distinct regions and parallel worlds, each aligning with the legal norms of their originating governments and informing players of the applicable rules. These MetaVerses adhere to a set of unified standard interfaces and protocols. Even legacy systems like the _**ancient SandBox**_ are connected to the mainverse through the Bridge Protocol.

The primary categories of MetaVerses include:



* **Digital Twin MetaVerse:** A digital replica of Earth, where everything strictly adheres to Earth's physical laws, including its legal framework, on a 1:1 reference.This can be perceived as an everlasting digital Earth where all skills and personas can be carried over to any other MetaVerse.



* **Magic Parallel MetaVerse:** A virtual realm for gamers where there's no need to adhere to Earth's physical laws. Here, you can transform into a magical creature wielding infinite magical powers. However, this world does not allow for inheritance.



* **Sci-Fi Parallel MetaVerse**: This MetaVerse strictly follows scientific principles, even those that are yet to be realized, making it a place where one can explore a variety of imaginative sci-fi futures. The experiences in this future MetaVerse world are not inheritable.



* **Historical Parallel MetaVerse:** These are simulations of various historical eras, with each parallel MetaVerse strictly adhering to the limitations and rules of its respective time period. You have the option to visit any historical MetaVerse that interests you. The experiences in these historical parallel worlds cannot be inherited.



* **Dark MetaVerse:** A decentralized public domain MetaVerse without rules, disregarding the "Three Principles of the MetaVerse," and featuring digital wormholes that link all parallel MetaVerses. This realm is a hotbed for countless innovative applications and harbors a multitude of dark secrets, crimes, and a constant battle between evil and justice.

Paradise Island is the largest third-party operational node of the public domain MetaVerse; AtomVerse is the most powerful decentralized Dark MetaVerse. AtomVerse is very special, as it is the only _**Decentralized**_ _**Quantum Computing AI autonomous MetaVerse.**_ Most of its nodes are hidden and parasitize within the complex network topology of the public domain MetaVerse.

Within the Dark MetaVerse, the line between virtuality and reality blurs. Its domain has grown in tandem with the expansion of the public domain MetaVerse, now surpassing the Digital Twin MetaVerse in size and becoming one of the largest **Fully-Immersive Metaverses** globally.
