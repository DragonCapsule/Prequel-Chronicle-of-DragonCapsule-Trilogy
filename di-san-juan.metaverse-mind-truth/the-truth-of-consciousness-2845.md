# The Truth of Consciousness (2845)

In 2835, the emergence of biological brain holographic cloning and printing technology allowed the complete copying of all human brain information. For the first time, human memory information was replicated on a clone, laying a solid physical foundation for the transfer of brain consciousness.

In 2841, Max, a scientist with Indian and Chinese dual descent, published a stunning paper - "**On the Truth of Consciousness"**, which proposed that in the time-space integration system, The **uniqueness migration** of the consciousness is one of the feasible ways which could keeping life continuation in the sense of anthropology.

And He also proposed that in the category of human ethics and morality, the host consciousness' active abandonment of itself and acceptance and legal authorization of the clone , are the material basis and ethical legal basis for the transfer of human consciousness.

For the first time, the "**seed consciousness**" was declared to exist in "On the Truth of Consciousness", and it was named "Alaya Consciousness" (the source of life in Buddhism). This is an unprecedented breakthrough in the study of human life. The paper finally concluded that the seed consciousness is the ultimate key factor in the transfer of human consciousness. Breaking through the bottleneck of seed consciousness transmission and migration can achieve the so-called "soul possession".

In September 2945, after a lengthy six-month trial, the first example of human brain holographic cloning and consciousness transfer experiment was successful, completing the **uniqueness transfer** of the subject's seed consciousness and truly realizing the successful transfer of human consciousness in the material, mental, social and ethical dimensions. For the first time, human beings broke free from the shackles of their original bodies.\


This historic moment is called the "**Max Singularity"**. In another sense, the Max singularity announced the arrival of the era of human immortality.







**Note 1:** **Alaya-vijnana:** "All sentient beings possess Alaya-vijnana inherently, complete and pure, transcending the worldly realm, identical to Nirvana." - **Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra**, Volume 2.

"Alaya-vijnana" is a Sanskrit term that can be translated as "the storehouse consciousness." In Chinese, it refers to the concept of "self." Humans have eight consciousnesses: visual consciousness, auditory consciousness, olfactory consciousness, gustatory consciousness, tactile consciousness, mental consciousness, mano consciousness, and alaya-vijnana. The first seven consciousnesses are subject to death and destruction, but the eighth consciousness, alaya-vijnana, represents our true essential nature. It can cycle through the realms of existence and undergo rebirth in heaven, human realms, and the six realms. It is eternal and cannot be annihilated.

In the Samyukta Agama Sutra, it is mentioned: "By what reason is nama-rupa (name and form) said to arise? By what reason is nama-rupa conditioned? This passage discusses how the Buddha continuously sought the root of the five aggregates and ultimately discovered that the essence of life lies in the fundamental consciousness, Alaya-vijnana.

**Note 2: Consciousness Uniqueness Transfer**: Once the seed consciousness completes its detachment from the original host and transfers to a clone, all legal identities, social relationships, status, and rights of the original host are inherited by the clone. The post processing of uniqueness transfer as follows: "Preservation in a dormant state for one month, followed by original materials destruction."
